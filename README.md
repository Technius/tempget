# Tempget

Tempget is a cross-platform utility program that downloads files into a
directory structure specified by a "template" file.

## Features

* Create template files to automatically specify what files to retrieve and
  where to place them.
* Cross-platform means it works on Windows, Mac, and Linux!
* (In the future) Selectively extract files from `.zip` (and other) archive
  files into desired locations.
* It's written in Rust!
