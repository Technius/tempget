# Tempget

Tempget is a cross-platform CLI utility program that downloads (and possibly
extracts) files into locations specified by a "template" file. Tempget can
download files in parallel, and it provides a nice command line interface with
progress indicators.

Examples of use cases:

* You want to download a bunch of programs from many different websites.
  However, you might need to do this multiple times, so instead of doing it
  manually, you create a template file that lists all of the URLs and run
  `tempget` to download them for you, in parallel.
* You're writing a script that needs to download and extract files at some
  point. Instead of writing download and extract commands manually, you create a
  template file and call `tempget` in the script.
* To install a mod for a game, you need to download a large number of assets
  from the internet, and they need to be placed in specific locations. You can
  simplify the installation process by creating a template file and using
  `tempget` to download and place the assets.

You can think of Tempget as "Template Getter" (automate your downloads by using
a template file to specify where to download the files from and where to place
them) or "Temporary Getter" (write your template file, download Tempget, run it
on your template, and then delete Tempget).

## Features

* Human-friendly CLI with progress indicators
* Create template files to automatically specify what files to retrieve and
  where to place them
* Selectively extract files from `.zip` archive files into desired locations
* Parallel file downloads
* Template files are specified in [TOML][TOML] and can be easily generated by
  another program
* Cross-platform with zero dependencies: works on Windows, Mac, and Linux!

## Installation

Pre-compiled Linux binaries are available on the
[Releases](https://github.com/Technius/tempget/releases) page.

If you are on Mac/Windows or you want to compile from source, run

```plain
cargo install --git https://github.com/Technius/tempget --tag latest-release
```

Remove the `--tag <version>` part to install the latest development version.

## Usage

First, create a template file. Templates use the [TOML][TOML] configuration
format.

### Template file format

The `retrieve` section describes which files to download and where to place
them. For example, the following template will download two files from the
specific URLs and save them to `my_file` and `some_folder/other_file`:

```toml
[retrieve]

# Format is
#     "location_on_disk" = "https://link_to_file"

"my_file" = "https://example.com/"
"some_folder/other_flie" = "https://example.com/some_file"
```

The `extract` section describes how to extract files from an archive, using the
zip archive files as keys. At the moment, each zip file can be handled in one of
two ways:

* __Extracting all of the contents of the zip file to a folder.__ The zip file
  should be mapped to the location of the folder to extract to:

  ```toml
  [extract]
  "my_zip_file.zip" = "somewhere/folder_to_extract_to/"
  ```
* __Extracting some files to particular locations.__ The name of the zip file should
  be a subsection of the `extract` section; this subsection maps files in the
  zip archive to the locations to extract to:
  
  ```toml
  [extract."my_zip_file.zip"]
  "folder_in_zip/file_in_zip" = "somewhere/file_to_extract_to"
  "other_file_in_zip" = "another_file_to_extract_to"
  ```
  
### Running the template download

Once you have created your template file, run

```plain
tempget template.toml
```

where `template.toml` is the name of your template file. You can configure what
`tempget` does by supplying command line flags; see `tempget -h` for more
information.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why would I want to use Tempget instead of a shell script?

To the best of our knowledge, Tempget is cross-platform while there are no
built-in cross-platform tools. or scripting languages that support the same
functionalities. It might be possible to write a similar tool in a
cross-platform scripting language such as Python, JavaScript, or Ruby, but it is
very likely that such a language must be installed before the language can be
used (e.g. Windows does not come with Python installed).

Additionally, for simple file download tasks, it becomes very tedious to write
scripts to download files to specific locations--especially if some files are
contained in zip files.

### Why would I want to use a shell script instead of Tempget?

Tempget is primarily for downloading files to specific locations. More complex
actions, such as executing arbitrary commands after downloading, can and should
be achieved with your choice of scripting language. If you need to extract all
files of a specific file format from a zip file and then post-process them,
you're probably better off writing a shell script. If you need to download and
compile code source, you're probably better off writing a shell script.

Of course, you can always use `tempget` as part of a script.

### Why is Tempget's file size so large?

To make the implementation simpler, Tempget uses many libraries. Since Tempget
is implemented in Rust, all of these libraries are statically linked into the
final `tempget` binary. This means that Tempget can run almost anywhere, but at
the cost of larger file sizes.
